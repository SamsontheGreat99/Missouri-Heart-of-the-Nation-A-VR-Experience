# Missouri-Heart-of-the-Nation-A-VR-Experience
This project is a virtual reality art exhibit that was build for the Missouri Bicentennial Celebration at the University of Missouri - Columbia

My work on this project consisted of writing the C# scripts, making the application playable, and managing the project throughout the Oculus store submission process.

It is currently available on the Oculus store for the Rift headest at: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/4132870663455479/
